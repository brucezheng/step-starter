# Google Student Training in Engineering Program

This repo contains **Bruce Zheng's** portfolio and STEP projects.

**STEP** is Google's STEP (Student Training in Engineering Program, formerly known as Eng Practicum 
in NA) is an internship for first and second-year undergraduate students with a passion 
for computer science. I (Bruce) was a host for the STEP program in 2020. I created this repo so that I
could follow along with the introductory material they needed to follow for the first half of the 
internship.

This work is based on the [Google Software Product Sprint](https://g.co/softwareproductsprint) program.
